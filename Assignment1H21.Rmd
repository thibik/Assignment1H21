Introduction

Short literature review

### ***Reproducibility in R***

The *R notebook* used in the software called *R*, is similar to a compendium, which means you can write texts and codes. This notebook is supported by tools like *“knitr”*, an integrated package in R, and *R-markdown*, which helps to integrate the codes, figures, and similar functions. By using R Markdown you can easily convert the notebook to formats like Microsoft World, PDF and others formats. Sharing the notebook online and giving access to other author is considered as simple. Therefore R Notebook may be the solution for reproducibility. 

## **Discussion**

In our society the focus on the computational science has increased and therefore there have been some fast-moving developments in many scientific areas. [KILDE: Peng 2011 LONG]. One of these areas is the reproducibility in data science. In other words, other authors can reproduce the document by using the same data which have been collected and written by someone else. [Kilde: BIOSTATS] This kind of reproducibility is based on that every computational experiment has a detailed log of every action made in a program, like R Studio.[KILDE:BIOSTAT].

The documents and its computations are referred to as a compendium, a distributable object and which is a mix between text and data. [KILDE:GENTLEMEN]. These compendiums are "easily comprehend, modified and extended". Which means an external author/reader could be able to reproduce without any complications. The reproducibility is important and necessary, first of all it creates more opportunity for new insights. This is done by using the same *compendium* by adjusting the data with the aim of achieving the same results. By executing this you would see other possibilities that one has not had in their mind.[KILDE:LABFOLDER] The risk of doing error will reduce by reproducing. This will ensure that texts and codes are correct, which again would increase the reliability. The result of a research or a studies may be incorrect and by letting your document/compendium be reproducible, will allow readers to understand your work better. 

The choice of reproducing the data or not will be based on your work. As written over, the reproducibility is based on that all computations done in research are recorded and is available to reuse. This could also be seen as a disadvantageous side of reproducibility if the data codes are no longer available to readers. As Peng told "Interactive software systems often used for exploratory data analysis typically do not keep track of users' actions in any concrete form.". [DirketeKILDE: PENG SHORT] 

Changing the behavior of the software systems or use other software systems that support reproducibility may resolve the problem, but because of the human nature, it will not happen quickly. One of the reasons is the hours someone have spent to learn. Even though if author changes their software systems, they have to make the data codes available. If they choose not to share their data codes, the point of reproducibility would not be relevant. Another barrier to reproducibility is the understanding of its culture. An ingrained culture that requires reproducibility for all scientific claims is necessary, and not everyone is familiar with this culture.
