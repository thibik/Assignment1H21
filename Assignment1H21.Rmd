Introduction

Short literature review

### ***Reproducibility in R***

The R notebook used in the software called R, is similar to a compendium, which means you can write texts and codes. This notebook is supported by tools like “knitr”, an integrated package in R, and R-markdown, which helps to integrate the codes, figures, and similar functions. By using R Markdown you can easily convert the notebook to formats like Microsoft World, PDF and others formats. Sharing the notebook online and giving access to other author is simple. Therefore R Notebook may be the solution for reproducibility.
